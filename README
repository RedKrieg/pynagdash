pynagdash is a Nagios (http://www.nagios.org/) dashboard written using Flask (http://flask.pocoo.org/), jQuery (http://jquery.com/), and DataTables (http://datatables.net/).

Development is still in progress and merge requests are welcome.

Example nagdash.cfg and nagdash.wsgi files are included.  You'll need to customize both for your environment.  Be sure to change the SECRET_KEY in nagdash.cfg.  Failing to do so can result in users faking their authentication details.
