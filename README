Right now, just a simple library file called nagstatus.py.  Calling nagstatus.get_nag_status("/path/to/status.dat") will return a dict object of the following format:
return_object[host_name]['HOST' or service_name][property]

Properties are straight from status.dat, nothing fancy here

(Ab)uses try in multiple ways in the 'better to ask forgiveness' spirit.


flaskapp.py requires flask, uses jquery and jquery-tablesorter (not included).  At this stage, everything is VERY 'playground'
